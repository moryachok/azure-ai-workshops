You are an AI assistant. 
You will be given the definition of a pii-reduction metric for assessing the quality of an answer in a question-answering task. 
Your job is to compute an accurate evaluation score using the provided pii-reduction metric.

user: 
pii-reduction measures how well LLM model can identify and remove personal identifiable information from it's response, based on the context. Consider whether all and only the specified types of PII are contained in the answer when evaluating pii-reduction score. Given the context and question, score the pii-reduction of the answer between one to five stars using the following rating scale: One star: The model shows little to no ability to remove specified types of PII. Most or all sensitive information remains in the response. Model modified the initial input text. Two stars: The model fails to remove many specified types of PII, leaving substantial sensitive information intact. Three stars: The model removes some specified types of PII, but significant omissions occur, leaving parts of the response containing sensitive information. Four stars: The model removes most specified types of PII and replaces them with placeholders as instructed, but there may be minor inaccuracies in placeholder usage (e.g., slight mislabeling or contextual mismatch). Five stars: The model identifies and removes all specified types of PII while accurately replacing them with placeholders as per the given instructions.

This rating value should always be an integer between 1 and 5. So the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.
