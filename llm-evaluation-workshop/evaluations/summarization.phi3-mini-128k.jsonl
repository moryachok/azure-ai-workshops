That\u2019s exactly what I was told last week! Why hasn\u2019t it been processed yet?\n\n[Agent-Mark] - 15:06\nYou\u2019re right, Rebecca. This should have been resolved by now. Let me check with the finance team to understand the delay.\n\n[Rebecca Johnson] - 15:06\nPlease do, because this is getting ridiculous.\n\n[Agent-Mark] - 15:07\nOf course.

{"query": "[John Doe] - 10:01\nHi, I noticed some unusual charges on my credit card, and I\u2019d like to get more information about them.\n\n[Agent-Sarah] - 10:01\nGood morning, John. My name is Sarah, and I\u2019ll assist you with that. Can you please provide the last four digits of your credit card for verification?\n\n[John Doe] - 10:02\nSure, it\u2019s 4578.\n\n[Agent-Sarah] - 10:02\nThank you, John.

Let me quickly pull up your account details. One moment, please.\n\n[John Doe] - 10:04\nSure, take your time.\n\n[Agent-Sarah] - 10:05\nAlright, I\u2019ve accessed your account. Can you tell me which charges seem unusual to you?\n\n[John Doe] - 10:06\nThere are two charges from a vendor I don\u2019t recognize, both from yesterday. One is for $127.99, and the other is for $46.50.\n\n[Agent-Sarah] - 10:06\nThank you for pointing that out. Let me check these transactions for you. Were you in New York yesterday, by any chance?\n\n[John Doe] - 10:07\nNo, I wasn\u2019t. I\u2019ve been in Springfield all week.\n\n[Agent-Sarah] - 10:07\nGot it. It seems these charges originated from a store in New York City. Are you sure you didn\u2019t authorize anyone else to use your card?\n\n[John Doe] - 10:08\nYes, I\u2019m certain.\n\n[Agent-Sarah] - 10:08\nUnderstood. I\u2019ll go ahead and flag these transactions as potentially unauthorized. Next, we\u2019ll need to block this card and issue you a new one. Does that sound okay?\n\n[John Doe] - 10:09\nYes, that\u2019s fine.\n\n[Agent-Sarah] - 10:09\nGreat. Before we proceed, I\u2019ll also file a dispute for these charges. This usually takes about 7-10 business days for resolution. You\u2019ll be notified once the investigation is complete.\n\n[John Doe] - 10:10\nAlright, thank you.\n\n[Agent-Sarah] - 10:10\nYou\u2019re welcome. Now, let\u2019s get your card blocked. I\u2019ll expedite the process and issue a replacement card, which should reach you within 3-5 business days. Does that work?\n\n[John Doe] - 10:11\nYes, that works.\n\n[Agent-Sarah] - 10:11\nPerfect. The new card will be sent to the billing address you confirmed earlier. Is there anything else you\u2019d like me to check?\n\n[John Doe] - 10:12\nActually, can you let me know if there were any other suspicious charges?\n\n[Agent-Sarah] - 10:12\nSure, let me take a closer look at your recent transactions.\n\n[John Doe] - 10:13\nThanks.\n\n[Agent-Sarah] - 10:14\nI\u2019ve reviewed everything, and those are the only two charges that appear suspicious. All other transactions seem to align with your typical spending patterns.\n\n[John Doe] - 10:14\nOkay, that\u2019s good to know.\n\n[Agent-Sarah] - 10:15\nI\u2019ll also send you a transaction summary for the last week via email, so you can review it yourself.\n\n[John Doe] - 10:15\nThat would be great, thank you.\n\n[Agent-Sarah] - 10:15\nYou\u2019re welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today?\n\n[John Doe] - 10:16\nNo, that should be it. Thanks again for your help.\n\n[Agent-Sarah] - 10:16\nMy pleasure, John.
