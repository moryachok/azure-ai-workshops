Hi, this is Rebecca Johnson. I’m calling for the third time about the refund for the broken TV during my residential move. It’s been over three weeks now, and I still haven’t received any updates.

[Agent-Mark] - 15:02
Good afternoon, Rebecca. I’m sorry to hear about this ongoing issue. Let me pull up your case file and see what’s going on. Can you provide your case ID or booking reference?

[Rebecca Johnson] - 15:03
It’s 589472.

[Agent-Mark] - 15:03
Thank you. One moment while I review your case.

[Rebecca Johnson] - 15:04
Sure, but honestly, I don’t have all day.

[Agent-Mark] - 15:05
I completely understand your frustration, and I appreciate your patience. I see here that the refund was approved on December 15th. However, it looks like the payment is still pending.

[Rebecca Johnson] - 15:05
Still pending? That’s exactly what I was told last week! Why hasn’t it been processed yet?

[Agent-Mark] - 15:06
You’re right, Rebecca. This should have been resolved by now. Let me check with the finance team to understand the delay.

[Rebecca Johnson] - 15:06
Please do, because this is getting ridiculous.

[Agent-Mark] - 15:07
Of course. I’ve just sent an urgent message to the finance team. While we wait for a response, I’ll escalate this case to my supervisor to ensure it’s prioritized.

[Rebecca Johnson] - 15:08
You should’ve done that the first time I called.

[Agent-Mark] - 15:08
You’re absolutely right, and I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused. Let me make this right for you now.

[Rebecca Johnson] - 15:09
I hope so.

[Agent-Mark] - 15:10
Rebecca, I’ve just received confirmation from the finance team. The payment is scheduled for processing today, and it should reflect in your account within 3-5 business days.

[Rebecca Johnson] - 15:10
And what guarantee do I have that this will actually happen?

[Agent-Mark] - 15:11
I completely understand your concern. I’ll personally monitor your case and ensure the payment goes through. I’ll also send you an email with a summary of today’s update.

[Rebecca Johnson] - 15:11
You’d better. Can I get a direct line or someone I can contact if this isn’t resolved?

[Agent-Mark] - 15:12
Yes, absolutely. You can reach me directly at 1-800-555-1234, extension 456.

[Rebecca Johnson] - 15:12
Alright. I’m holding you accountable for this.

[Agent-Mark] - 15:13
I understand, Rebecca. Again, I’m very sorry for the trouble this has caused you. Is there anything else I can assist you with while we’re on the call?

[Rebecca Johnson] - 15:13
No, just make sure the refund happens.

[Agent-Mark] - 15:14
Understood. Thank you for your time, and I’ll follow up with you personally to confirm the refund is processed. Have a good day.

[Rebecca Johnson] - 15:14
We’ll see. Goodbye.

[Agent-Mark] - 15:14
Goodbye, Rebecca.
