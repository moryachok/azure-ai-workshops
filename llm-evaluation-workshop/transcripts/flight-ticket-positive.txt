Hi there! I’m looking to buy a flight ticket to Miami for this weekend. Can you help me out?

[Agent-Jessica] - 14:32
Hi, Michael! Absolutely, I’d love to help you with that. Let’s get started. What day are you planning to fly out?

[Michael Roberts] - 14:33
I’m thinking Saturday morning, and I’ll come back Sunday evening.

[Agent-Jessica] - 14:33
Perfect, a quick weekend getaway! Let me check some options for you. Where will you be flying from?

[Michael Roberts] - 14:34
I’ll be flying out of Chicago.

[Agent-Jessica] - 14:34
Got it. Give me just a second to pull up the flights for you.

[Michael Roberts] - 14:35
Sure, take your time.

[Agent-Jessica] - 14:36
Alright, Michael, here’s what I found. There’s a 7:00 AM direct flight to Miami on Saturday, and for the return, there’s a 7:30 PM direct flight on Sunday. Does that work for you?

[Michael Roberts] - 14:36
Yeah, those times sound perfect!

[Agent-Jessica] - 14:37
Great! Do you have a seating preference—window, aisle, or middle?

[Michael Roberts] - 14:37
Window, please.

[Agent-Jessica] - 14:37
Window seat, noted. Now, for baggage—are you traveling light, or do you need checked bags?

[Michael Roberts] - 14:38
Just a carry-on.

[Agent-Jessica] - 14:38
Got it! And would you like to add travel insurance for an extra $15?

[Michael Roberts] - 14:39
Hmm, sure, why not.

[Agent-Jessica] - 14:39
Awesome! So here’s the breakdown: your round-trip ticket with a carry-on and travel insurance comes to $325. Shall I go ahead and book it?

[Michael Roberts] - 14:40
Yeah, let’s do it!

[Agent-Jessica] - 14:40
Alright! Can I confirm your name as it appears on your ID?

[Michael Roberts] - 14:41
Yeah, it’s Michael Roberts.

[Agent-Jessica] - 14:41
Perfect. And can you provide an email address for your e-ticket?

[Michael Roberts] - 14:42
Sure, it’s michael.roberts@gmail.com.

[Agent-Jessica] - 14:42
Got it. Last step—would you like to pay with a card or use travel points?

[Michael Roberts] - 14:43
I’ll use my card.

[Agent-Jessica] - 14:43
Alright, please provide the card details whenever you’re ready.

[Michael Roberts] - 14:44
It’s a Visa, number 4111-1111-1111-1111, expiry 12/25, and the CVV is 123.

[Agent-Jessica] - 14:44
Thank you! Processing your payment now…

[Michael Roberts] - 14:45
Okay, great.

[Agent-Jessica] - 14:46
All done! You’re all set for your trip to Miami. You’ll receive your e-ticket in the next 5 minutes. Anything else I can help you with?

[Michael Roberts] - 14:46
Nope, that’s it. Thanks so much, Jessica!

[Agent-Jessica] - 14:46
You’re welcome, Michael! Have an amazing trip!

[Michael Roberts] - 14:47
Thanks! Have a great day.

[Agent-Jessica] - 14:47
You too! Goodbye!
