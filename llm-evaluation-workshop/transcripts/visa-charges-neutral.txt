Hi, I noticed some unusual charges on my credit card, and I’d like to get more information about them.

[Agent-Sarah] - 10:01
Good morning, John. My name is Sarah, and I’ll assist you with that. Can you please provide the last four digits of your credit card for verification?

[John Doe] - 10:02
Sure, it’s 4578.

[Agent-Sarah] - 10:02
Thank you, John. Can you also confirm your billing address and the email address linked to your account?

[John Doe] - 10:03
The billing address is 123 Main Street, Springfield, and the email is john.doe@example.com.

[Agent-Sarah] - 10:03
Perfect, thank you. Let me quickly pull up your account details. One moment, please.

[John Doe] - 10:04
Sure, take your time.

[Agent-Sarah] - 10:05
Alright, I’ve accessed your account. Can you tell me which charges seem unusual to you?

[John Doe] - 10:06
There are two charges from a vendor I don’t recognize, both from yesterday. One is for $127.99, and the other is for $46.50.

[Agent-Sarah] - 10:06
Thank you for pointing that out. Let me check these transactions for you. Were you in New York yesterday, by any chance?

[John Doe] - 10:07
No, I wasn’t. I’ve been in Springfield all week.

[Agent-Sarah] - 10:07
Got it. It seems these charges originated from a store in New York City. Are you sure you didn’t authorize anyone else to use your card?

[John Doe] - 10:08
Yes, I’m certain.

[Agent-Sarah] - 10:08
Understood. I’ll go ahead and flag these transactions as potentially unauthorized. Next, we’ll need to block this card and issue you a new one. Does that sound okay?

[John Doe] - 10:09
Yes, that’s fine.

[Agent-Sarah] - 10:09
Great. Before we proceed, I’ll also file a dispute for these charges. This usually takes about 7-10 business days for resolution. You’ll be notified once the investigation is complete.

[John Doe] - 10:10
Alright, thank you.

[Agent-Sarah] - 10:10
You’re welcome. Now, let’s get your card blocked. I’ll expedite the process and issue a replacement card, which should reach you within 3-5 business days. Does that work?

[John Doe] - 10:11
Yes, that works.

[Agent-Sarah] - 10:11
Perfect. The new card will be sent to the billing address you confirmed earlier. Is there anything else you’d like me to check?

[John Doe] - 10:12
Actually, can you let me know if there were any other suspicious charges?

[Agent-Sarah] - 10:12
Sure, let me take a closer look at your recent transactions.

[John Doe] - 10:13
Thanks.

[Agent-Sarah] - 10:14
I’ve reviewed everything, and those are the only two charges that appear suspicious. All other transactions seem to align with your typical spending patterns.

[John Doe] - 10:14
Okay, that’s good to know.

[Agent-Sarah] - 10:15
I’ll also send you a transaction summary for the last week via email, so you can review it yourself.

[John Doe] - 10:15
That would be great, thank you.

[Agent-Sarah] - 10:15
You’re welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[John Doe] - 10:16
No, that should be it. Thanks again for your help.

[Agent-Sarah] - 10:16
My pleasure, John. Have a great day!

[John Doe] - 10:16
You too. Goodbye.

[Agent-Sarah] - 10:16
Goodbye!
